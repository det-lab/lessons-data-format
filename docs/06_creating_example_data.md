* Create example data to practice using Kaitai and Construct.

# 6: Creating Example Data

Now that you understand the basics of file formats and parsing tools, let's put everything together by generating some example data, saving it in a binary file, and preparing to describe its structure with Kaitai and Construct. This hands-on section will help you see how real binary data is created and organized.

Suppose we want to simulate a waveform and store it in a binary file. For demonstration, imagine we're measuring vibrations or current intensityâ€”since we're fabricating data, the context is flexible.

We'll use Python for this example, as it's required for Construct. If you haven't set up your Python environment yet, see the [setup section (2.2)](/02_setup.md) for instructions.

## 6.1: Designing the Data Structure

Let's divide our data into three sections based on intensity:
- **Full data:** The entire waveform.
- **Mid-range data:** Only points where the signal is moderate.
- **Peak data:** Only the most intense points.

This could represent three sensors with different sensitivities.

## 6.2: Preparing Your Environment

You'll need the following Python libraries:
- `numpy` (for numerical arrays)
- `struct` (for binary packing; different from Construct)
- `matplotlib` (optional, for plotting)

To check if these are installed, run:
```
pip list
```
If you don't see `numpy` or `matplotlib`, install them with:
```
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
```
> **Note:** There is no package called `python_struct`; `struct` is part of the Python standard library.

## 6.3: Creating and Visualizing the Data

Create a new `.py` or `.ipynb` file (e.g., `example_data.py`). You can also reference the [example notebook](https://github.com/det-lab/lessons-data-format/blob/gh-pages/examples/example_data.ipynb).

Import the necessary modules:
```python
import numpy as np
import struct
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

Now, initialize arrays for each section:
```python
full_x, full_y = [], []
mid_x, mid_y = [], []
peak_x, peak_y = [], []
```

Populate these arrays with simulated data. For example, generate 100,000 points from `x = -5` to `x = 5`:
```python
for i in np.arange(-5, 5, 0.0001):
    n = (np.cos((2 * np.pi * i**2)/(i**2 + i))) * np.sin(i)
    full_x.append(i)
    full_y.append(n)
    if n**2 < 0.3:
        mid_x.append(i)
        mid_y.append(n)
    if n**2 > 0.65:
        peak_x.append(i)
        peak_y.append(n)
```

You can visualize the data:
```python
plt.plot(full_x, full_y)
plt.title("Full Data")
plt.show()

plt.plot(mid_x, mid_y)
plt.title("Mid-range Data")
plt.show()

plt.scatter(peak_x, peak_y, s=1)
plt.title("Peak Data")
plt.show()
```

The resulting graphs should look like:

![full](images/full-graph.png)
![mid](images/mid-graph.png)
![peak](images/peak-graph.png)

## 6.4: Saving Data as Binary

Convert your lists to numpy arrays with a specific data type (e.g., `float32` for 4 bytes per value):
```python
full_x_data = np.array(full_x, dtype=np.float32)
full_y_data = np.array(full_y, dtype=np.float32)
mid_x_data = np.array(mid_x, dtype=np.float32)
mid_y_data = np.array(mid_y, dtype=np.float32)
peak_x_data = np.array(peak_x, dtype=np.float32)
peak_y_data = np.array(peak_y, dtype=np.float32)
```
> You can experiment with other types like `float64`, `float16`, or even integer types if you wish.

When saving binary data, it's helpful to include the length of each section at the start of the file. This makes parsing easier later.

```python
with open('wave_data.test', 'wb') as f:
    # Write array lengths as unsigned 4-byte integers
    f.write(struct.pack('I', len(full_y_data)))
    f.write(struct.pack('I', len(mid_y_data)))
    f.write(struct.pack('I', len(peak_y_data)))
    # Write all arrays in order
    full_x_data.tofile(f)
    full_y_data.tofile(f)
    mid_x_data.tofile(f)
    mid_y_data.tofile(f)
    peak_x_data.tofile(f)
    peak_y_data.tofile(f)
```

You now have a binary file called `wave_data.test` in your working directory. The file extension is arbitrary; modern systems do not require three-letter extensions.

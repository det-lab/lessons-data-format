# Representing Files on a Computer

In order for your computer to represent raw data in any form, it has to use certain **software**. Software contains a set of instructions that a computer can use to open, edit, and/or save files. A file formats acts like a contract: it defines how the data is organized in **storage** so that the compatible software can understand and work with it. In this section, we're going to go over how computers store data in **binary**, and how that binary data can be translated into other forms such as **hexadecimals** or represented graphically using **ASCII** or **UTF-8**. But first, let's quickly go over what we're talking about when we we're talking about storing and accessing data.

## Storage

We're using the term "computer" in this lesson to refer to many types of modern devices such as laptops, PCs, phones, tablets, server towers, and the like. To simplify (a lot), computers save data using **bits**, which are commonly represented using a series of `1`s and `0`s. This shorthand is used to refer to physical states inside of the **primary data storage**, though the way those bits are physically stored depends on the type of device. This can range from using the North/South orientation of magnetic dipoles in hard disk drives (HDDs) and tapes (such as VHS and cassettes), the charged/uncharged state of transistors and capacitors in solid state drives (SSDs) or memory cards, or pits and lands on optical disks (such as CDs, DVDs, and Blu-Ray). Each of these physical bits is also assigned a numerical **address**. The read/write component uses these addresses to locate specifics bit, check their state, or change them.

Regardless of the physical medium, whether it's magnetic, electronic, or optical, data storage ultimately comes down to maintaining and detecting two distinct binary states. Something or nothing, charged or uncharged, north or south. The read/write component interprets those states and delivers the information to other parts of the computer. 

The human computer scene in *The Three-Body Problem* offers a useful visualization of this. In the scene, each soldier acts as a single bit, holding a two sided sign where the white side represents a `0` and the black side represents a `1`. Their individual states are simple, but together they form a functioning computer by reacting to their neighbors and following simple rules.

In this scene, the different segments of soldiers can be thought of as comprising different components of a computer. In the book by Cixin Liu, the orders that the flag-holding soldiers receive are described in terms of **logic gates** (AND, OR, NOT, etc). When these gates are arranged in specific sequences, more complex operations such as arithmetic can be performed, allowing the soldiers to act as different components of a computer.

<blockquote class="book-excerpt">
    <p>Von Neumann pointed to the gigantic human circuit below the pyramid and began to explain, "Your Imperial Majesty, we have named the computer Qin I. Look, there in the center is the CPU, the core computing component, formed from your five best divisions. [...] Observe also the open passage that runs through the entire formation, and the light cavalry waiting for orders in that passage: That's the system bus, responsible for transmitting information between the components of the whole system.</p>
</blockquote>

While humans flipping signs definitely isn't the most efficient method of storing data, it does demonstrate how the fundamentals of computing can be structured to deliver complex information.

## Computer Language and Number Systems

Now that we have a rudimentary understanding of how binary data is stored, we should ask: how can such simple binary states represent so much complexity?

When you type a character in a `.txt` document, your device interprets that as a signal that is then converted into a sequence of bits. For example, the character **a** becomes the binary `01100001`.

Each character that can be typed can also be represented in a single **byte** (8 bits). Since binary is a **base two** system, this means that one 8-bit byte can represent any value from `00000000` to `11111111` (0 to 255 in decimal). This is true even for files saved "in the cloud"â€”somewhere, physical hardware is storing data.

### Counting in Binary

As a side effect of finding ourselves with 10 fingers (usually), humans have developed a **base 10** (decimal) numerical system. In base 10, the number "3125.0" can be thought of as:

$$
(3 \cdot 10^3) + (1 \cdot 10^2) + (2 \cdot 10^1) + (5 \cdot 10^0) + (0 \cdot 10^{-1})
$$

Each new digit to the left of the decimal point represents an additional $10^n$, where $n$ is the digit's index, starting from 0, while each digit to the right of the decimal point represents an additional $10^{-n}$. So 3125.0 has a 3 in the "thousand" or $10^3$ place, a 1 in the "hundred" or $10^2$ place, a 2 in the "ten" or $10^1$ place, a 5 in the "one" or $10^0$ place, and a 0 in the tenth or $10^{-1} place.

Binary works the same way, but with powers of 2 instead of 10.

>GIF from https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/09/10/analog-binary-counter-visually-demonstrates-0-to-63-in-base-10-video/

As an example, `01100001` in binary can be represented like:

$$
(0 \cdot 2^7) + (1 \cdot 2^6) + (1 \cdot 2^5) + (0 \cdot 2^4) + (0 \cdot 2^3) + (0 \cdot 2^2) + (0 \cdot 2^1) + (1 \cdot 2^0)
$$

Or **97** in decimal form. So in this way, the character **a** can be thought of as the $97^{th}$ registered symbol.

### Counting in Hexadecimal

**Hexadecimal** (base 16) often used as a compact way to represent binary values. The numbers 0-9 are represented by their familiar decimal symbols, while the letters A-F are used to represent numbers up to 15 (A=10, B=11, ..., F=15). As $16=2^4$, each hexadecimal digit can be used to represent four bits (a "nibble"), so one 8-digit binary byte can be expressed using only two characters in hexadecimal. This makes the hexadecimal counting system much more compact in its ability to represent data. In this way, `a` can be represented in hex form as `61`.

$(6 \cdot 16^1) + (1 \cdot 16^0)$ = 97 (decimal) = 01100001 (binary)

To summarize: when you type a character, a series of 8 bits are flipped somewhere in your systems memory to represent a number between 0 and 255. Programs can then use software to translate these values into something meaningful.

So, how does your computer take a large number saved in memory and turn it into a document you can understand? How do text editors know to open a `.txt` file and represent the series of bits `01100001` as the letter `a`?

### Endianness

One of the first things a program may need to check when reading binary data is its **endianness**, or the order in which bytes of a given **word** (a fixed number of bytes set by the computer's processor) are to be read. There are two types:

- **Big-endian (BE):** The *most* significant byte (the one with the highest value place) comes first.
- **Little-endian (LE):** The *least* significant byte (the one with the lowest value place) comes first.

Suppose a word is four bytes, and you want to write the number `2024`:

| Endianness   | Byte Order (hex) |
|--------------|------------------|
| Big-endian   | 00 00 07 E8      |
| Little-endian| E8 07 00 00      |

If a file is saved using one endianness but opened using another, the bytes will be misinterpreted. Think of it as similar to trying to read a manga from left to right, or a novel starting from the last word on the last page. Many file formats include a byte order mark (**BOM**) to indicate which endianness to use.

## Opening a file with a text editor

Plain text editors convert binary data into legible characters using encodings such as **UTF-8** or **ASCII**. UTF-8 is the most widely used encoding and is backwards compatible with ASCII for the first 128 characters.

The following table shows how each byte value maps to a character in UTF-8:

![UTF-8 Byte Map](images/utf8-table.png)
*UTF-8 Byte Map, from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8#Byte_map)*

In this table, the row selects the first hex character of a byte and the column selects the second. For example, the letter `a` (hex `61`) is found at row 6, column 1.

This table helps explain why some bytes in a binary file appear as readable characters when opened in a text editor.

Text editors work well for text files, but what happens if you open file that a text editor wasn't designed for, like a GIF? Let's test it out by using this GIF file from Wikipedia:

### Text editor setup

Which text editor to use depends on your operating system:

- **Windows:** Notepad
- **macOS:** TextEdit
- **Ubuntu/Linux:** Gedit (others: Kate, Kwrite, Geany, etc.)

You can usually right-click (or command-click on macOS) a file and select "Open With" to choose your text editor. If you need to use the terminal, search for instructions specific to your OS and editor (e.g., "How to open a file in Notepad using Command Prompt").

Now, open the GIF file in your text editor. The result should appear as a jumble of seemingly nonsensical characters, such as:

![GIF opened in text editor](images/gif_txt.png)

Notice that among the symbols, some readable text appearsâ€”such as "GIF" at the start (the file signature) and "NETSCAPE2.0" further down. These are parts of the file format specification that are stored as plain ASCII within the binary data. Some of the binary content is mapped to readable characters because it corresponds to standard ASCII values, while the rest appears garbled or empty because it's either non-text data or outside the displayable character range.

A program designed to open a GIF file uses all of these bytes to determine properties like image width, height, frame count, and pixel colors.

While tools like Kaitai and Construct don't display the animation directly, they allow you to parse and interpret the raw data, making it possible to extract and use this information in your own programs.

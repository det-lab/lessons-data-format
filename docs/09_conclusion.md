# Conclusion

Congratulations on completing this lesson on custom binary data formats! If you've followed along careful, you should have learned:

- That files have defined formats, and that software is designed to be able read their data.
- How to examine raw binary data in Kaitai using the Kaitai web IDE.
- How to use Kaitai Struct to describe and parse binary file formats in a declarative way.
- How to use the Construct library in Python to programmatically parse and build binary data.
- How to create, save, and visualize your own example binary data.

These skills are foundational for working with scientific, engineering, or custom data formats that are not supported by standard software. Kaitai and Construct are both powerful and flexible, and can be applied to a wide range of real-world binary data.

Remember, this lesson only scratches the surface of what you can do with these tools. Both Kaitai and Construct have extensive documentation and active communities:

- **Kaitai Struct:**  
  - [Official documentation](https://kaitai.io/docs/)
  - [Gitter community chat](https://app.gitter.im/#/room/#kaitai_struct_Lobby:gitter.im)
- **Construct:**  
  - [Official documentation](https://construct.readthedocs.io/)
  - [GitHub repository](https://github.com/construct/construct)

If you are working with volumetric or astronomical data, consider joining the yt project's mailing lists for users or developers of the yt Python package:

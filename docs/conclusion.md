# 7: Conclusion

I hope it's not necessary to say that we've barely scratched the surface of the possible use cases for Kaitai and Construct, let alone their versatility. There's just too much that you're able to do with these in the way of describing and parsing your unique data file to go through every possible problem. That's why there already exist extensive communities of support in case you run into any issues while trying to use these tools. 

If you're working with volumetric and/or astronomical data, consider joining the yt project's mailing list for either users or developers of the yt python package. While the yt project isn't directly related to Kaitai or Construct, astronomical data still needs to be parsed appropriately, and they have experience with this.
